# Customer Segmentation Using KMeans

This project uses the **KMeans clustering algorithm** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. By analyzing customer data, the goal is to group similar customers together, enabling businesses to understand their customer base and personalize marketing efforts.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a common technique in data science that helps businesses categorize their customers into different groups. These groups share common traits, such as similar spending behavior, preferences, or demographics. In this project, we use **KMeans**, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to perform clustering.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform raw data into a format suitable for clustering.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Apply KMeans to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
- **Visualization**: Use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize the resulting clusters.
- **Evaluation**: Analyze and validate the clustering results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for data processing and machine learning.
- **Scikit-learn**: The library used for implementing the KMeans algorithm and other machine learning tasks.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: (Optional) For documenting the code and running experiments.
